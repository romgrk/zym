# Text editor widget

> Evaluation for index.md → "Code editing → Text editor": *"Consider a custom
> widget or a fork of GtkSourceView … multiple cursors, rectangular selection,
> better performance with large files. Consider a JS widget, or a Rust widget
> with a JS wrapper."*

The question is **whether to keep building on `GtkSource.View` or own the text
widget**, judged against the features a full editor needs. The short answer:
**stay on GtkSourceView and emulate the two things it can't do natively
(multi-cursor, block-select) on the seam the editor model already exposes**;
treat a custom widget as a gated escape hatch, not the next step. The rest of
this page is the evidence for that, and what each path actually costs.

This updates the earlier conclusion (keep `GtkSource.View`, proven for
tree-sitter highlighting + tag-based folding) by extending it to the three
harder features the task names.

## Current state (what already sits on the widget)

Reused, not rebuilt — see `src/ui/TextEditor/`:

- **`TextEditor.ts`** — `GtkSource.View` + `GtkSource.Buffer`, tree-sitter
  highlighting + `invisible`-tag folding (`SyntaxController`), a `GtkSource.Map`
  minimap, file I/O, and modal editing (vim, or `GtkSource.VimIMContext` behind a
  toggle).
- **`EditorModel.ts`** — an Atom-`TextEditor`-shaped model over the buffer
  (`Point`/`Range`, scanning, markers, mutation, undo). **It already surfaces
  `getCursors()` / `getSelections()` / `getCursorsOrderedByBufferPosition()` as
  arrays**, today 1-element because `GtkTextBuffer` has a single
  `insert`/`selection_bound` mark pair. The vim port deferred multi-cursor here
  on purpose — *this array API is the seam the multi-cursor work plugs into.*
- **`MarkerLayer.ts` / `Marker.ts`** — markers backed by anonymous
  `GtkTextMark`s with gravity, the primitive a real multi-cursor implementation
  needs (extra cursor/selection mark pairs live here).

So the editor's *logic* layer is already abstracted away from "one cursor"; only
the *backing* (one mark pair) and *rendering* (one native caret) are single-cursor.

## Feature checklist vs. GtkSourceView

| Feature | On GtkSourceView | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Syntax highlighting (tree-sitter) | **Built** (ours) | `setHighlightSyntax(false)` + own `TextTag`s. Upstream is regex `.lang` only; tree-sitter is discussed but unmerged (gtksourceview#124). |
| Code folding | **Built** (ours) | No upstream fold API in GtkSource 5; we use the `invisible` `TextTag`. |
| Gutter (line nums, diagnostics, git bars, breakpoints) | **Native** | `GtkSourceGutterRenderer`; Builder's omni-gutter is the model. |
| Inline virtual text / diff / blame / inlay hints | **Native-ish** | `GtkSourceAnnotations` (since 5.18); fallbacks: `TextChildAnchor`, `insert_paintable`, overlays. Exact annotation rendering unverified. |
| Diff display (inline + side-by-side) | **Doable** | Inline via annotations/virtual text; side-by-side via two synced views + blank regions. (index.md item.) |
| Search UI | **Doable** | `GtkSource.SearchContext` exists; or own box wired to vim `/`. |
| Minimap | **Native** | `GtkSource.Map` (already used). |
| Multiple cursors | **Emulate** | No native support — `GtkTextBuffer` has one mark pair. Proven on-top (see Option A). |
| Rectangular / block / column selection | **Emulate** | No native support; depends on the same multi-cursor infra. |
| Large line *counts* (M+ lines) | **Native, fine** | Only visible paragraphs are laid out. |
| Pathological long *single* lines (minified) | **Unfixable** | The one hard wall — see constraints. |
| IME / bidi / a11y / clipboard / DnD | **Native, free** | The expensive-to-rebuild subsystems all come for free here. |

The decisive rows: the features GtkSourceView *can't* do natively are
multi-cursor, block-select, and long-line performance — and exactly those trace
to two parts of GtkTextView you can't override (the single mark pair and the
per-paragraph Pango layout).

## Options

### Option A — Stay on GtkSourceView, emulate the gaps **(recommended)**

Keep the widget; build multi-cursor and block-select on top, the way **GNOME
Builder already does**: a list of virtual cursors, each its own
`insert`+`selection_bound` `GtkTextMark` pair, extra carets drawn via
`set_visible()` + a highlight `TextTag` (or a `snapshot_layer` pass), every edit
replayed per cursor in an *after*-handler (`ide-cursor.c`). Rectangular
selection falls out of the same infra (a column of virtual cursors).

In quilx this lands **on the existing seam**: grow `EditorModel`'s
`getCursors()`/`getSelections()` from 1-element to N-element arrays backed by
`MarkerLayer` mark pairs, and the vim layer (which already iterates those arrays)
gets multi-cursor largely for free.

- **Pros:** keeps the entire built stack (vim, tree-sitter, folding, minimap,
  file I/O); IME/bidi/a11y/clipboard stay free; lands incrementally on an
  already-prepared API; lowest risk.
- **Cons:** emulated multi-cursor is real, maintenance-heavy code that fights a
  one-cursor buffer (Builder's has filed edge-case bugs: dismissal, write-without-
  delete, keybinding conflicts); doesn't fix long single lines.
- **Effort:** medium. **Risk:** low–medium (correctness of edit-replay).

### Option B — Fork GtkSourceView

Patch a real multi-mark / block-selection model into the C widget.

- **Verdict: reject.** Inherits C + a fork to maintain against upstream, and the
  hardest part (long-line Pango layout) still isn't fixed because it lives in
  GTK's `GtkTextView`/`GtkTextLayout`, below GtkSourceView. Worst of both — fork
  cost without solving the thing only a new widget solves. Also off-path for a
  JS/node-gtk codebase.

### Option C — Own the widget (custom GTK4 text widget)

A from-scratch `GtkWidget` whose `snapshot()` paints code via Pango/GSK. This is
the only path that fixes long lines *and* makes multi-cursor/block-select native.

The research is encouraging on **rendering** and sobering on **everything
around it**:

- **Rendering is the safe part.** GTK4 already gives the two things GPU editors
  hand-roll: a glyph texture atlas and retained render-node caching (`snapshot()`
  runs on invalidation, not per frame). **VTE** is the proven GTK4 reference
  (custom monospace grid via `gsk_text_node_new` + `append_color`, its own
  `GtkScrollable`, `GtkIMMulticontext`, frame-clock redraws). Per-line
  PangoLayout/node caching + viewport culling is the documented strategy.
- **node-gtk can drive it from JS.** Subclassing `Gtk.Widget` and overriding
  `snapshot()` from JS is demonstrated in the node-gtk repo
  (`examples/gtk-4-custom-widget.js`). Subject to our known constraints
  (instantiate after the main loop, ≥3-char GType name, camelCase→snake_case
  vfunc mapping).
- **The hard, expensive subsystems you'd rebuild:** the private `GtkTextLayout`
  middle layer (per-line layout cache, viewport virtualization, display-line vs
  paragraph, height index) — the largest single cost; **IME** (consume
  `GtkIMMulticontext`, but preedit splicing + `filter_keypress` ordering are
  fiddly); **bidi**; **a11y** (`GtkAccessibleText`, needs GTK ≥ 4.14). These are
  precisely what GtkSourceView gives for free.
- **The open risk:** per-frame JS↔native FFI cost of doing `snapshot()` from
  node-gtk is **unmeasured**. Mitigated by GTK's invalidation model (paint on
  edit/scroll/blink, not 60 fps) and per-line node caching, but unproven here.

Sub-shapes, if Option C is ever taken:

- **C1 — JS-only snapshot widget.** Rope/parse/multi-cursor model in TS, render
  in JS. Simplest interop (no second language/runtime).
- **C2 — Rust core + JS rendering (the "Rust widget" the task floats, done
  right).** Rust **core** (`ropey` + tree-sitter + tree-sitter-highlight +
  multi-cursor/selection model) as a napi-rs Node addon supplying text,
  highlight spans, and cursor geometry; the **GTK4 widget stays JS/node-gtk**
  doing `append_layout` rendering. Keeps one main loop, one thread, no GObject
  handoff, no GIR generation — lowest-risk way to get a Rust core. No prior art
  pairs a Rust core with GTK4 custom rendering, but every piece is individually
  proven.
- **C3 — fully-Rust gtk-rs widget exposed via GIR.** **Reject.** Works in
  principle (precedent: `rdw`) but needs a manual C-header → `g-ir-scanner` →
  typelib pipeline the gtk-rs toolchain won't automate; the pointer-handoff
  alternative needs a node-gtk patch (`WrapperFromGObject` isn't exported to JS)
  and has zero precedent. Cost without payoff for an app that owns both sides.

- **Effort (C1/C2):** very large. **Risk:** high (layout-cache rebuild, IME/bidi/
  a11y correctness, FFI perf). Telling signal: **no major Rust editor uses GTK** —
  Zed/Lapce/COSMIC all went GPU-direct, Helix is a TUI; the fast GTK editors
  (GNOME Text Editor, gedit) are C-on-GtkSourceView.

## Recommendation (staged)

1. **Now: Option A.** Multi-cursor and rectangular selection via virtual
   cursor/selection mark pairs on `MarkerLayer`, surfaced through
   `EditorModel.getCursors()/getSelections()` (already array-shaped) and rendered
   with a `snapshot_layer` / `TextTag` pass. Unblocks both named features with no
   rewrite and no loss of the vim/syntax/fold investment.
2. **Long lines: accept the upstream guard.** Adopt GtkSourceView's own
   posture — detect and warn/refuse to fully load pathological single-line files
   rather than hang. Revisit only if real workloads make it intolerable.
3. **Keep Option C as a gated escape hatch.** Pursue only if native multi-cursor
   or long-line editing becomes non-negotiable. If so: **C2** (Rust core + JS
   snapshot widget), and **gate it behind a one-day node-gtk `snapshot()` FFI
   perf spike** (render ~50 visible lines, measure frame time + invalidation
   cadence) before committing. **Never C3.**

## Revisiting (2026-06-16): "are we fighting GtkSourceView?"

Building **inline single-line folding** (`function x() { [...] }`) surfaced the
recurring question: should we stop emulating and own the widget? The honest read
on the friction, and the decision framework — kept here so we don't re-litigate
from scratch each time it bites.

**The friction is one root cause, and it recurs by design.** Every feature that
has cost a workaround — folding, virtual/inline text, inline widgets (the overlay
timing dances), per-view cursors, decorations leaking across views — traces to
the *same* property of **GtkTextView**: its model is "a buffer of text with tags,
one cursor, one view," and presentation is not separable from the buffer. There
is also no way to reserve horizontal space mid-line without a real buffer char
(the wall that pushed single-line folding to an overlay that renders the closing
delimiter). The roadmap is presentation-heavy (inline AI, peek, code lens, color
swatches, fold variants, multi-cursor, split views), so the workaround tax
compounds. This is a legitimate inflection point, not premature optimization. The
industry signal agrees: serious custom editors (VS Code, Zed, Monaco, CodeMirror,
Lapce) all own their text rendering.

**The fork (Option B) is definitively out — sharper reason than before.** The
things we fight don't live in GtkSourceView; they live in **GtkTextView**, which
is **GTK core**. GtkSourceView is gutters/highlighting/search layered on top of
GtkTextView's buffer+layout. To change the model (buffer/presentation split,
mid-line layout, the insert-mark-is-the-cursor coupling) you'd have to fork GTK
itself, build it, and ship it through node-gtk forever — all the cost of owning a
text stack with none of the design benefit. Rule it out for good.

**Don't big-bang rewrite; make it data-driven.** A from-scratch `GtkWidget` (the
existing **Option C / C2**) makes the exact things we fight *free* — we'd own the
layout pass, so folding, virtual lines, inline widgets, N cursors, and per-view
cursors are all just "where do I draw." It's the plausible endgame. But the
decision must hinge on three **node-gtk-specific unknowns**, all answerable by one
focused, timeboxed spike (this is the gate the recommendation already names,
concretized):

1. **Render perf (make-or-break)** — a `Gtk.Widget` subclass that snapshots ~50
   visible lines via cached `PangoLayout`s and implements `GtkScrollable`: does it
   scroll smoothly and type lag-free, driving `snapshot()` from JS? Mitigated by
   GTK's invalidation model (paint on edit/scroll/blink, not 60fps) + per-line node
   caching, but the per-frame JS↔native FFI cost is unmeasured.
2. **IME** — wire `GtkIMContext` directly into the custom widget; confirm
   commit/preedit. This is the sharp edge that leaked in the overlay-peek POC, and
   the subsystem GtkSourceView gives for free.
3. **GtkScrollable + adjustments** — viewport/scrollbar integration.

If those pass, the custom widget is viable and the rest is (large but derisked)
work — and it reuses what we already own (tree-sitter model, vim layer, the
`EditorModel`/`MarkerLayer` seam). If per-frame JS drawing is janky, the answer is
definitive: stay on GtkSourceView. Either way we replace a guess with a number.

**Ship presentation features as view-layer concerns now — it's non-committal.**
Folding's single-line marker is being built as a **zero-buffer-footprint overlay**
(the marker widget renders the closing delimiter + tail, Pango-styled from the
real text), *not* a `GtkTextChildAnchor` (which would push `U+FFFC` into the buffer
→ offset shift → corrupt LSP/save while folded, re-coupling model and view exactly
where the document-registry refactor is paying that coupling down). Treating
folding (and inline widgets generally) as a pure *view* concern is correct
regardless of the widget question, and the same logic ports to a custom widget
unchanged. So feature work does not deepen the GtkSourceView lock-in and does not
block on the spike.

**Decision rule:** stay on GtkSourceView; build presentation features in the view
layer (zero buffer footprint); run the render spike to unlock-or-confirm the
Option C gate before committing to any rewrite. Related friction evidence:
[inline-widgets.md](inline-widgets.md), [document-registry.md](document-registry.md),
[virtual-lines.md](virtual-lines.md).

## Constraints carried from the research (cited; mark-uncertain noted)

- **Single mark pair.** `GtkTextBuffer` has exactly `insert` + `selection_bound`
  — one cursor, one selection — unchanged in GTK4. No native multi-cursor or
  rectangular selection. (docs.gtk.org `class.TextBuffer`; GtkSourceView
  PainPoints wiki.)
- **Multi-cursor is proven on top, and fragile.** GNOME Builder's `ide-cursor.c`
  (parallel mark pairs + per-cursor edit replay). GNOME Text Editor still lacks
  it; described upstream as needing "deep changes into GtkSourceView"
  (gnome-text-editor#253). *Uncertain:* GTK4-era Builder impl details.
- **Long single lines are the one unfixable wall.** Each paragraph is one
  indivisible `PangoLayout`, so a giant line defeats visible-only layout; gedit
  FAQ calls it "a known limitation of GtkTextView [that] cannot be fixed easily,"
  and GtkSourceView's loader may refuse such files (gtk#229, gtksourceview#95 /
  #208). Large line *counts* are fine. *Uncertain:* GTK4 crash status, loader
  thresholds, exact big-O.
- **No upstream tree-sitter or fold API** in GtkSource 5; both are ours already
  (highlighting via PCRE2+JIT `.lang` upstream; folding via `invisible` tag).
- **Extensibility is additive, not replaceable.** Gutter renderers, `TextTag`s,
  `snapshot_layer` (BELOW/ABOVE text), `GtkSourceAnnotations` (≥5.18) cover
  gutter/inline/virtual-text needs — but you cannot replace the per-line Pango
  layout, which is the part owning the widget would be *for*.
- **Custom rendering is well-supported; the surround is the cost.** GTK4 atlas +
  retained nodes make glyph painting cheap (VTE proves the GTK4 path; node-gtk
  proves the JS `snapshot()` override). The bulk is rebuilding the private
  `GtkTextLayout` (layout cache + viewport virtualization) plus IME / bidi /
  a11y. *Uncertain (flagged for a spike):* per-frame node-gtk FFI cost; exact
  `appendLayout` wrapper name.
- **Rust-in-process is realistic but not turnkey.** One libgtk + one GType
  registry + one main loop (node-gtk's) supports co-residency, but exporting a
  Rust gtk widget needs a manual GIR/typelib pipeline (C2 sidesteps this by
  keeping rendering in JS and Rust as a pure-logic napi core). Best Rust building
  blocks: `ropey`, tree-sitter + tree-sitter-highlight; **avoid** cosmic-text
  inside GTK (redundant with Pango, bypasses GTK's accelerated text path).
  *Uncertain:* no project proves "Rust core + GTK4 custom snapshot widget" end to
  end — recommendation is assembled from individually-proven pieces.

## Editor seams other features depend on

Since the widget stays on GtkSourceView, the work is a small set of shared
primitives in the editor layer that the other features (LSP, diff, search, vim
polish, multi-cursor) plug into. Status:

- [x] **Buffer change events** — `EditorModel.onDidChangeText` (Atom
  `{changes:[{oldRange,newRange,oldText,newText}]}` shape), backed by the
  buffer's `insert-text`/`delete-range` signals (extents computed pre-edit) and
  flushed post-mutation on `changed`. Replaced the former inert stub. Consumers:
  vim undo/redo (`misc-command.js`), LSP `didChange` (`TextEditor.installLsp`),
  and the future multi-cursor edit-replay. (`EditorModel.ts`, tests in
  `EditorModel.test.ts`.)
- [x] **Viewport + pixel geometry** — `getFirstVisibleScreenRow` /
  `getLastVisibleScreenRow` (visible buffer rows) and `pixelRectForBufferPosition`
  (widget-relative cell rect for anchoring popovers). Realized-view-guarded with
  whole-buffer / null fallbacks; the realized paths (`getVisibleRect`/
  `getLineAtY`/`getIterLocation`) need interactive verification. Consumers: LSP
  hover & code-action popovers, vim H/M/L + scroll commands, side-by-side diff
  scroll-sync. (`EditorModel.ts`.)
- [x] **Inline decoration surface** — `DecorationController` / `DecorationLayer`
  (`editor.decorations`): clearable, named layers of GtkTextTag *background* spans,
  re-synced by their producer. Styles: `highlight`/`highlight-strong` (search),
  `added`/`removed` (diff). Tags sit above syntax priority. (`DecorationController.ts`,
  tests in `DecorationController.test.ts`.)
- [x] **Drawn-underline overlay** — `UnderlineOverlay`: a transparent
  `Gtk.DrawingArea` over the text that strokes anti-aliased Cairo sine waves under
  buffer ranges, replacing GtkTextTag's fixed dense `Pango.Underline.ERROR`
  squiggle. Used by `DiagnosticsView` for diagnostic squiggles (gutter glyphs stay
  a Nerd-Font `GutterRendererText`). Wave amplitude/wavelength are tunable
  constants; the drawn result needs interactive verification (no headless render).
  Inline virtual text (`GtkSourceAnnotations`, 5.18+ — we're on 5.20) lands with
  its consumers. (`UnderlineOverlay.ts`, test in `UnderlineOverlay.test.ts`.)
- [ ] **Virtual lines & inline virtual content** — *investigated, not built.* See
  [virtual-lines.md](virtual-lines.md): line-trailing text via `GtkSourceAnnotations`,
  general virtual lines via a `pixels-above/below` gap-tag + buffer-coord overlay
  (`VirtualLineController` primitive). Wanted by inlay hints, error lens, git
  blame, code lens, AI ghost text, and live inline diff. POC recommended.

## What's next (recommended order)

The shared primitives above are done, so the remaining work is features that sit
on them. Ordered by value-given-readiness:

### 1. Search — *done*

- [x] **Search engine** — `SearchController` (`SearchController.ts`): incremental
  literal/regex search over the buffer via `EditorModel.scan`, `highlight` on all
  matches + `highlight-strong` on the current one through `editor.decorations`,
  nearest-from-origin seating, `next`/`previous` (direction-aware), cancel-restores-
  origin, and replace-current / replace-all (regex backrefs). Headless tests in
  `SearchController.test.ts`.
- [x] **SearchBar widget** — `SearchBar.ts`: a compact bar floating top-right
  (`Gtk.Overlay`, theme popover background). One horizontal row: the search and
  replace `Gtk.Entry`s (both always shown, linked into one control, monospace,
  fixed-width so the match count can't reflow them), then the count, a 3-way case
  button (smart / sensitive / insensitive), and a regex toggle. Regex mode adds
  inline regex/`$`-ref syntax highlighting in both inputs (`regexHighlight.ts`,
  Pango attributes). Options toggle by key — **Alt+S** cycles case, **Alt+R**
  toggles regex (shown in tooltips; Alt+C was taken by `tab:close`). Incremental
  highlight + cursor preview; in search **Enter/Shift+Enter** step (relative to
  the cursor), in replace **Enter** replaces the current match and **Ctrl+Enter**
  replaces all. **Esc** confirms at the current match (returns to origin only when
  there's no match); focus-out (click into editor) confirms. While the bar holds
  focus the editor keeps its active caret (no inactive-caret flicker).
- [x] **Vim `/` `?` `n` `N`** — `/`/`?` open the bar (forward/backward), `n`/`N`
  repeat the last search relative to the cursor (`TextEditor.installSearch`,
  normal-mode keymap). Smartcase is the default case mode.

Not yet (search refinements, low priority): `*`/`#` word-under-cursor search;
search history; operator-pending `d/foo<CR>` (search as a motion); `:%s///` via the
ex command line (below).

### 1b. Command line (`:` ex-commands) — *WON'T DO* (decided 2026-06-14)

We are **not** building a vim `:` ex-command line. The commands it would have
restored are already reachable elsewhere: save via `space w` (`file:save`),
close via `tab:close` / `pane:close`, open via `space o` (the fuzzy file picker),
and search/replace via the SearchBar. So `:w`/`:q`/`:e`/`:%s` are covered without
a modal command prompt, and the `command-bar-text`/`command-text` status the
removed `VimIMContext` emitted stays gone.

### 2. Multi-cursor / blockwise — *done*

The widget-evaluation's marquee feature, built on Option A as planned.
`getCursors()`/`getSelections()` are N-element over `MarkerLayer` mark pairs;
`hasMultipleCursors`/`mergeCursors`/`mergeIntersectingSelections`/
`onDidAddSelection` are real (no longer stubs), and `Selection.onDidDestroy`
backs per-selection register clipboard. Entry points: blockwise `ctrl-v`,
occurrence `c o p`, and persistent `ctrl-alt-↑/↓` add-cursor (`escape` collapses).
Extra carets render as reverse-video block tags in normal/visual and host-drawn
beam carets in insert (`onExtraCursors` → a caret-widget pool in `TextEditor.ts`).
Multi-cursor operations coalesce into one undo step (`mutateSelections` in one
`transact`); insert is **live-replicated** to every cursor — each typed
chunk/backspace is mirrored on a deferred microtask (off the `changed` signal, to
avoid invalidating the in-flight edit's iters). Tests: `blockwise.test.ts`,
`multicursor.test.ts`, `occurrence.test.ts`.

Remaining (in-app verification / edges): beam-caret visuals + `ctrl-alt-arrow`
keys can't be tested headless; an insert *session* undoes in a couple of steps
(the native keystroke and the mirror flush are separate GTK user actions);
replication covers insertions + single-line backspaces, with multi-line deletes /
mid-text replacements falling back to the leave-insert replay.

### 3. Quick cleanups — *any time*

- [x] **Fold-aware motions** — `EditorModel.isFoldedAtBufferRow`/`unfoldBufferRow`
  now delegate to `SyntaxController` (via a `FoldProvider` the host wires in with
  `setFoldProvider`), so the vim motions that consult them (`motion.js`/`utils.js`)
  skip past and reveal folded rows instead of treating the buffer as unfolded.
- [x] **Buffer-only editor mode** — `new TextEditor({ buffer: { placeholder,
  initialText, onSubmit } })`: no file I/O / LSP / line-numbers / minimap, keeps
  vim + syntax + search, a greyed placeholder over the empty buffer, `getText`/
  `setText`, and Ctrl+Enter → `onSubmit`. For the Git commit-message editor.
- [x] **Column-unit reconciliation** — convention pinned to **codepoint** columns
  (matching `GtkTextIter` + `lsp/position.ts`). Fixed the UTF-16 holdouts that fed
  Points: `EditorModel.pointAtTextOffset` (scan/search), the `.length`-as-column
  sites in `Cursor.ts` + vendored `operator.js` (via new `EditorModel.lineLength`),
  and `searchWordUnderCursor`. Tests with emoji/astral chars in `EditorModel.test.ts`.
  Tree-sitter highlighting is also reconciled: `SyntaxController.iterAt` converts
  web-tree-sitter's UTF-16 columns to codepoints, gated on a per-refresh
  `hasAstral` check so BMP-only files (the norm) pay nothing. *Remaining holdout:*
  the incremental-parse edit tracking (`onInsert`/`onDelete`) still mixes codepoint
  iter offsets with UTF-16 string lengths, so editing right next to an astral char
  can feed tree-sitter a slightly-wrong edit — rare; its own task.
- [x] **Vim polish** — `H`/`M`/`L` screen motions and `ctrl-f/b/d/u/e/y` scroll
  commands, flash-on-operate, and **`=`/`==` auto-indent** are done. `=` re-indents
  to a real tree-sitter indent source: `SyntaxController.indentLevelForRow` counts
  enclosing fold-block nodes (`syntax/indent.ts`), injected into the editor via
  `EditorModel.setIndentSource` (falls back to copy-the-line-above when no grammar);
  it also improves paste-reindent.
- [x] **Matching brackets** — highlights the bracket under (or just before) the
  cursor and its pair, or — when the cursor sits *inside* a pair (not adjacent) —
  the innermost *enclosing* pair, so the brackets stay lit as you move between them
  (`syntax/bracketMatch.ts` + a cursor-driven tag in SyntaxController). Brackets
  inside strings/comments/regex are ignored (`SyntaxController.isInStringOrComment`,
  via `indent.ts` `enclosingTypeMatches`).
- [x] **Indent guides** — faint vertical lines per indentation level, drawn in the
  leading whitespace (`IndentGuideOverlay`, a Cairo overlay like the diagnostic
  squiggles). Levels follow the actual indentation and continue unbroken through
  blank lines inside a block. Toggle with `editor.indentGuides`.
- [x] **Tree-sitter text objects** — `if`/`af` (function), `ic`/`ac` (class /
  interface / enum), `ia`/`aa` (arguments). Backed by `SyntaxController`'s
  `functionRangeAt`/`classRangeAt` (the generic `enclosingNodeRange` in `indent.ts`,
  outer = whole def, inner = body), surfaced via `EditorModel.getFunctionRange`/
  `getClassRange` to the vim `Function`/`Class` text objects.
- [x] **Folds query** — folding is driven by a grammar's `folds.scm` (`@fold`
  captures, incl. multi-line comments; `GrammarDef.foldsPath`, compiled to
  `Grammar.foldsQuery`) when present, else the `foldTypes` set. Plus **run folds**:
  consecutive import statements / line comments collapse to their first line. Pure
  `computeFoldRanges` (`syntax/folds.ts`, unit-tested); `foldTypes` is retained for
  the indent source. TS ships `queries/{typescript,tsx}/folds.scm`.
- [x] **JSX/HTML tags** — *auto-close*: typing `>` to finish an opening tag inserts
  `</name>` and sits between them (`tagClose.ts`, pure + unit-tested). Text-based
  (the tree is debounced) with a JSX-vs-generics heuristic (the `<` must not follow
  an identifier) and a tag-language gate (`tsx`/`html`/… — so plain `.ts` generics
  never close). Fragments → `</>`. *Co-rename*: the `tag:rename` command renames
  both halves of the pair (or a self-closing tag) in one undo step, via
  `SyntaxController.tagNamesAt` (tree, `syntax/tags.ts`, unit-tested) + a prefilled
  prompt. (Live linked-editing — mirror as you type — is a possible follow-up; it
  needs mark-tracking across the tree's mismatch gap.)

### 4. Diff display — *investigated; sequence with Git*

See [diff.md](diff.md) for the editor-side investigation. Conclusion: render both
unified and side-by-side from **synthesized read-only buffers** (the alignment
fillers / deleted lines are real padded lines, styled via `editor.decorations`),
which sidesteps GtkTextView's lack of virtual lines and reuses the buffer-only +
decoration + scroll-sync primitives already landed. No new widget primitive is
required; the editor-side gaps are small (read-only mode, a diff gutter renderer,
a couple of decoration styles, scroll-sync, hunk nav). The real dependency is the
diff *data*, which comes from the **Git** workstream — so build it alongside Git.
