# Multibuffer — one editable, excerpt-backed editor substrate

**End-state:** every `TextEditor` renders a *projection* over an ordered list of **excerpts**
(each a source + a range), with one cursor and continuous scroll. A normal file is the
degenerate case — one full-file excerpt. Stitched ranges from **many files** appear with
filename headers, each highlighted by its own grammar, editable, writing through to the files.
The forcing function is the multi-file diff/search surface (replacing `GitStagingView` and
powering project-wide search-replace) — like Zed's project-search / project-diff multibuffer,
but editable and per-language-correct.

Built **hard parts first**, on `GtkSourceView` (the view buffer is a *materialized projection*
of its sources, because GtkTextView needs real text). The editor has no users; the single-file
editor's behavior + the headless suite are the regression net.

Branch: `feat/multibuffer-staging` (G5 staging + G1 one-editor merge).

## Architecture (as built)

Three layers — all shipped and live:

- **Source** — a parsed text unit: a `Document` (live/new side, via `DocumentRegistry`) or a
  parsed blob (old/base side). Owns its model buffer + shared `DocumentSyntax` parse + LSP doc +
  file I/O. `Document` no longer owns view/sync/fold logic.
- **`ViewProjection`** (`src/ui/TextEditor/ViewProjection.ts`) — pure, GTK-free coordinate map
  over an ordered `Item[]` (`segment`s over sources + synthesized `block` rows). Maps
  **source `(sourceKey,row,col)` ↔ projection ↔ view**, with **folds composed as a second
  transform**. `segment = { source, range, editable, kind: 'real' | 'phantom' }`. A single
  full-file segment with no folds `isIdentity` → every translation short-circuits (zero-cost
  single-file path). Editability gate (`isViewRangeEditable`) rejects block/phantom/cross-source/
  folded ranges. No-fold **row-direct** fast path so in-place edits need no remap.
- **`ProjectionView`** (`src/ui/TextEditor/ProjectionView.ts`) — per-view materialize +
  bidirectional sync over a `ViewProjection`. Write-through (view→source, clamped to one editable
  segment), reverse-sync (source→view, incremental mirror; `retarget` = minimal-churn splice
  re-diff for computed surfaces), incremental re-segmentation (`resegment`/`adjustItems`),
  `retarget` (re-derive items + splice), and is the **`UndoTarget`** coordinating a multi-file
  edit as one transaction. `setResyncHandler` lets a computed surface (the diff) re-derive from
  scratch on a row-count reverse-sync.
- **Painter** — `SyntaxController` highlights the view buffer two ways (`paintViewLines`):
  - **single-source** (a normal file): pulls the one `DocumentSyntax`'s captures and maps them
    **through the fold map** (`viewIterForModel`/`modelLineRange`) — **fold-aware**.
  - **projection** (a multibuffer): `ExcerptSyntaxProjection.paintSlices` pulls each excerpt's
    source captures and places them with a **linear** source→view mapping (`sliceIter`) — **NOT
    fold-aware** (see the invariant below).

**Surfaces** (thin orchestrators over a normal `TextEditor` natively backed by a
`MultiBufferDocument`, so vim/search/decorations come free — UI classes carry no `MultiBuffer` in
their name; that's the model layer):
- `SearchResultsView` (project search) — `src/ui/SearchResultsView.ts` (UI lives in `src/ui/`; the
  `multibuffer/` dir is the MODEL layer only).
- `ContinuousDiffView` (git diff) — `src/ui/ContinuousDiffView.ts`;
  `buildDiffMultiBuffer` (`diffMultiBuffer.ts`, model) windows each file (context ±3, runs ≥2 elided
  to a `⋯` gap), `diffSegments.ts` does the line-diff → items (eq/ins → editable new-side, del →
  phantom old-blob rows).

## Status (G1–G11)

- **G1 — One substrate.** ✅ **Done.** Single-file + both multibuffer surfaces run on
  `ViewProjection`/`ProjectionView`, and `TextEditor` is now natively backed by a `TextEditorSource`
  (`src/ui/TextEditor/TextEditorSource.ts`): `Document` (one file/source) or `MultiBufferDocument`
  (`src/ui/multibuffer/`, N sources over one `ProjectionView`). The buffer-mode duality is gone —
  the `externalBuffer`/`syntaxProjection`/`undoTarget` injection knobs and the scratch-`Document`
  shim are deleted; a multi-source backing reports `isMultiSource` and the editor derives `embedded`
  (no own line numbers / minimap / LSP / git gutter / folding) from it. Buffer-only mode (commit
  message, diff panes, picker) stays a clean file-less `Document` + `BufferEditorOptions`
  (`src/ui/TextEditor/BufferEditor.test.ts` pins it). **By design, the one remaining painter branch
  stays:** `SyntaxController` keeps a fold-aware single-source path and a fold-naive projection
  path, because **multibuffer is folding-off** (see Invariants). Unifying them = making the
  projection painter fold-aware, the only thing gating folding-on multibuffers — deliberately
  deferred, not a loose end.
- **G2 — Editable everywhere.** ✅ single-file (identity), project search, and diff all write
  through to live `Document`s; replace-all across files is one transaction.
- **G3 — Folds are a transform.** ✅ single-file (code folding); per-excerpt collapse done as an
  item-level re-derive (G8), not a view-fold.
- **G4 — Per-source-correct.** ✅ highlighting, line-number gutters (project-search
  `SourceLineNumberGutter`; diff `CombinedDiffLineNumberGutter` — old|new in one renderer), decorations.
  *Diagnostics / LSP across excerpts = Phase 4.*
- **G5 — Continuous multi-file editable diff.** ✅ surface built + GUI-verified (write-through,
  phantom rejection, live re-diff with no flash/caret-jump, gutter alignment, expand-context
  `zo`/`zR`/`zm`). **Hunk staging ✅** (`feat/multibuffer-staging`): each file's index blob (`git
  show :p`) is read and every changed row classified staged/unstaged (the same model `GitGutter`
  uses — staged = HEAD↔index, unstaged = index↔worktree); a gutter marker bar shows it (info/blue =
  staged, warning/amber = unstaged). `space h s`/`space h u` (scoped to `#TextEditor.continuous-diff`
  so bare vim `s`/`u` stay substitute/undo) → `diff:stage-hunk`/`diff:unstage-hunk` build the hunk
  patch (`formatHunkPatch`) and `applyPatch --cached` (`--reverse` for unstage), then re-read the
  index + repaint markers (no geometry reflow — staging doesn't touch the worktree↔HEAD diff).
  Partial-file (per-hunk) staging works; external index moves refresh via `git.onChange`. Tested:
  `ContinuousDiffStaging.test.ts` (real temp-repo round-trip). **Commit ✅** — `space g c` →
  `git:start-commit` opens `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` in a tab (save+close commits). **`GitStagingView`
  retired ✅** — view + `openStagingView`/`stagingViews` + `git:open-staging` + the `#GitStagingView`
  keymaps deleted; `space g o` now opens the diff multibuffer (the replacement). *Remaining polish:
  hunk-level discard on the surface (whole-file discard still lives on `GitPanel`).* Also one
  deferred polish: the gutter band beside the filename
  widget can't be painted the header color (node-gtk blocks gutter background drawing) — see
  `tasks/code-editing/gutter-cell-background.md`.
- **G6 — Editable project search + replace-all.** ✅ (`space *`; `file:save` routes to the active
  multibuffer).
- **G7 — Cross-source undo/redo.** ✅ `ProjectionView` is the `UndoTarget`; re-entrant user
  actions; multi-file edit = one Ctrl-Z.
- **G8 — Multibuffer interaction.** ✅ vim works (real editor); expand-context (diff); **copy is
  clean** — headers AND gaps are now widget bands in BOTH surfaces (no block rows in any buffer; the
  search `⋯` gap stopped being buffer text), so a yank across excerpts carries only real source
  lines, with no copy-time filtering; **per-excerpt collapse** (`SearchResultsView`, `z a` toggle /
  `z M` all / `z R` none) re-derives the items so a collapsed file shows only its first source row
  (`▸` chevron) — an item-level transform, NOT a view-fold (keeps the painter fold-naive per the
  Invariant). All three band consumers (diff, search, markdown image preview) reconcile through one
  shared `BlockBandSet` (`BlockDecorations.bands()`).
- **G9 — Multiple diff sources.** ☐ only working-tree vs HEAD today; commit / PR / range TODO.
- **G10 — Performance.** ◐ single-file identity is zero-cost. *Viewport virtualization across many
  excerpts = TODO if profiling demands.*
- **G11 — Session persistence.** ☐ serialize/restore multibuffer tabs; also a close-confirmation
  for a file edited ONLY in a multibuffer (unsaved edits discarded on close).

## Next pickup

### ~~Task A — finish G5: staging ops on the editable diff, then retire `GitStagingView`~~ ✅ DONE

Shipped on `feat/multibuffer-staging` (see G5 above). The design question resolved to: **keep the one
worktree↔HEAD editable surface**, classify each changed row staged/unstaged against the index, and
show it with a **gutter marker bar** (info/blue = staged, warning/amber = unstaged) — not sections.
`space h s`/`space h u` stage/unstage the hunk at the caret; `space g c` commits; `GitStagingView`
is deleted (`space g o` now opens the diff multibuffer). *Only remaining bit: hunk-level discard on
the surface (whole-file discard still lives on `GitPanel`).*

### ~~Task B — merge `TextEditor` and the multibuffer surfaces into one (the G1 cleanup)~~ ✅ DONE

`TextEditor` is now backed by a `TextEditorSource` interface (`src/ui/TextEditor/TextEditorSource.ts`)
with two implementations: `Document` (one file/source) and `MultiBufferDocument`
(`src/ui/multibuffer/MultiBufferDocument.ts`, N sources over one `ProjectionView`). The surfaces pass
`source: new MultiBufferDocument(pv, painter)` and shrank to thin orchestrators. **Deleted:** the
`externalBuffer`/`syntaxProjection`/`undoTarget` knobs on `BufferEditorOptions` and the scratch-
`Document` shim. A multi-source backing reports `isMultiSource`; the editor derives `embedded`
(no own line numbers / minimap / LSP / git gutter / folding) from it, while a peek view stays
file-backed (keeps LSP + the shared parse). Buffer-only mode (commit message, diff panes, picker) is
unchanged — a file-less `Document` + the `BufferEditorOptions` presentation knobs — and pinned by
`src/ui/TextEditor/BufferEditor.test.ts`. The naming rule held throughout: UI carries no
`MultiBuffer` (`SearchResultsView`/`ContinuousDiffView`/`SourceLineNumberGutter`/`HeaderBands`;
commands `project:search-results`/`git:continuous-diff`); the model keeps it (`MultiBufferModel`,
`MultiBufferDocument`, `buildDiffMultiBuffer`, `ViewProjection`/`ProjectionView`).

*Optional remainder (deferred): fold the single-source painter into the one-segment projection case
in `SyntaxController` — a clean internal `documentSyntax`-vs-`syntaxProjection` branch, not the
duality, so low-value / high-risk to touch.*

### Backlog (after the two pickups)

- **Gutter band background** (G5 polish, blocked on node-gtk) — `tasks/code-editing/gutter-cell-background.md`.
- **G9** more diff sources (commit / PR / range); **G10** viewport virtualization (only if profiling
  demands); **G11** session persistence + a close-confirmation for a file edited ONLY in a
  multibuffer. (G8 — copy + per-excerpt collapse — is done.)

## Invariants

- **Multibuffer is folding-OFF, by design.** The projection syntax painter
  (`ExcerptSyntaxProjection`) maps each excerpt's source rows to view rows **linearly** — it does
  NOT translate through a fold map. So a multibuffer surface MUST keep code folding off, and the
  editor enforces this: a multi-source backing (`isMultiSource`) sets `folding: false` and the
  `embedded` flag (see `TextEditor`). Single-file editors fold normally — their *coordinates* go
  through the same fold-aware `ProjectionView` substrate, but their *highlighting* uses the
  separate fold-aware single-source painter path. Making the projection painter fold-aware (so a
  multibuffer could fold) is the one deferred G1 item; until then, **do not enable folding on any
  multibuffer surface** — captures would land on the wrong rows once a region collapsed.

## Gotchas worth knowing before touching this

- **Scheduling re-flow under the GLib loop.** A re-diff/re-layout that must run *after the current
  command places the caret but before paint* MUST use a **GTK tick callback** (`addTickCallback`),
  NOT `queueMicrotask`/`Promise`/`setTimeout(0)` — Node drains microtasks only on a libuv turn,
  which never happens during the GLib main loop, so a microtask-scheduled re-diff silently never
  runs in the app. (`ContinuousDiffView.scheduleMicroReDiff`.) Tests must drive a realized view +
  `GLib.MainContext.iteration(true)`, not `await`. See the `queuemicrotask-dead-under-glib-loop`
  memory. **Two timings, two tools:** *before-paint* work (a re-diff that must land in the same
  frame as the caret move) → `addTickCallback`; *after-settle* work where the view buffer is
  ALREADY correct and only a derived map must catch up (a one-frame lag is invisible) → a
  macrotask is fine, and `setTimeout` DOES fire under the GLib loop (libuv is pumped every loop
  iteration — see the `js-timers-refactor` memory). `ProjectionView.scheduleSync` (the multi-source
  reverse-sync remap/rebuild for undo + cross-view edits) is the latter: it uses `setTimeout`,
  because the reverse-sync handlers already mirrored the exact edit into the view synchronously;
  only `this.projection` (the gutter/painter coordinate map) needs to catch up. It MUST NOT be a
  `queueMicrotask` — that never fires in the app, leaving the map stale until the next edit forces a
  synchronous resegment (the "corrupts, then a later edit fixes it" symptom). Corollary: anything
  that reads the coordinate map in reaction to a buffer `changed` (the search results' band
  reconcile, which anchors each header via `viewRowForSource`) must NOT run while a remap is pending
  — a reverse-sync `changed` fires *during* the mirror, when the map is still stale. `SearchResultsView`
  skips its reconcile when `ProjectionView.isSyncPending()` and re-runs it from `setReflowHandler`
  (fired after the deferred rebuild), so headers always anchor off the fresh map. Write-through
  edits resegment synchronously (no pending sync), so they reconcile inline on `changed` as before.
- **Cross-segment edits must be rejected at the FUNNEL, not in write-through.** A view range can be
  contiguous yet map to a non-contiguous source range — two regions of one file are the same source
  in different segments, with hidden rows between them. `EditorModel.setTextInBufferRange`'s
  `editableAt` gate (→ `ViewProjection.isViewRangeEditable`) requires a SINGLE SEGMENT, so such an
  edit is refused before GTK mutates the buffer. Rejecting later (in `ProjectionView.writeThrough*`)
  is too late: the `insert-text`/`delete-range` handlers are *before* handlers, so returning early
  skips the SOURCE write but GTK still applies the edit to the VIEW — view and source diverge
  (visible as a visual-`c`/`d` across two regions deleting the wrong lines).
- **Overlay bands (headers/gaps/images) must be reconciled in place, not torn down.** Removing +
  re-adding a `BlockDecoration` collapses its reserved band and re-expands it a frame later
  (flicker + text jump). The one shared mechanism is **`BlockBandSet`** (`BlockDecorations.bands()`):
  `reconcile(specs)` matches bands by a stable `id`, rebuilds a widget only when its content `key`
  changed, and adds/removes the delta — used by `ContinuousDiffView`, `SearchResultsView`, and the
  markdown image-preview plugin. Headers AND gaps are widget bands (never buffer rows).
- **Per-row gutter alignment.** An excerpt's first row carries a header band ABOVE it, so its
  gutter number must bottom-align (`yalign=1`); rows with a `⋯` gap band BELOW stay top-aligned.
  Toggled per row inside the renderer's `queryData` (the only gutter vfunc node-gtk invokes).
- **Computed surfaces re-derive, they don't row-shift.** The diff's segment structure can't be
  maintained by row arithmetic through row-count changes that cross fragmented phantom/new
  segments; it re-derives via `setResyncHandler` → `reDiff` → `retarget`.

## Hard problems still open

- **Per-source decorations across excerpts**: diagnostics/inlay/LSP key off one Document today;
  must place through the unified map for multi-file (G4 remainder).
- **Viewport virtualization** across thousands of excerpts (G10) — a sum-tree coordinate map only
  if profiling demands it.
- **Gutter cell background drawing** in node-gtk (G5 polish) — blocked, see its task doc.

(Resolved, for reference: boundary-edit clamping, cross-source undo, folds-as-transform,
zero-cost single-file identity, the `Document` view/sync/fold extraction — all done.)
