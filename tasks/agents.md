# Agents

Run coding agents (Claude today, other tools later) inside quilx. **Two rendering
implementations** share one workbench / list / lifecycle / worktree spine — they
differ only in how a turn is displayed:

- **`claude-tui`** *(shipped default)* — the agent's own terminal UI hosted in a
  `Vte.Terminal` tab. Mature; live status via Claude Code hooks.
  `src/ui/AgentTerminal.ts` + `src/agents/claude-tui/session.ts`.
- **`claude-sdk`** *(opt-in via `agent.implementation: "claude-sdk"`)* — drives a
  persistent `claude -p` stream-json process headlessly and renders the
  conversation in **native GTK widgets** (no terminal, no Ink/Vte repaint cost).
  Deep dive: **[agents/claude-sdk.md](agents/claude-sdk.md)**.

`src/agents/configs.ts` is the kind registry — `resolveAgentKind()` picks the kind
from the config flag (default `claude-tui`); a single `AppWindow.openAgent()`
launch path serves both, each agent getting its own workbench.

The open work is **depth, cross-kind**: agent profiles/customization (incl. tools
other than claude), richer management UX, git-worktree integration, and reviewing
an agent's diff — detailed below. Per-feature pages split out as they grow
(`agents/claude-sdk.md` already has).

## Current state

What already exists and is reused, not rebuilt:

- **Per-person workbenches** — `src/ui/Workbench.ts` is a first-class object: one
  person's dock frame (left/right/top/bottom/center) **plus the widgets that fill its
  slots** — its own `center`, `fileTree`, Source-Control, `leftPanel`, and the four
  bottom-dock panels — with an `owner` field naming its person. **Each person in the
  WorkbenchList owns a fully self-contained `Workbench`; nothing is shared or reparented
  across workbenches.** `buildWorkbench(owner, cwd)` constructs those widgets (rooted at
  `cwd`) and hands them
  to `new Workbench(owner, contents, { showSideDock })` (which docks the center, and
  Source-Control for the user); it registers the workbench in `AppWindow.workbenches`
  (owner → `Workbench`). `AppWindow` holds only `this.workbench` (the active one) and
  reads all per-person state straight off `this.workbench.*` (`this.workbench.center`,
  `this.workbench.bottomDock`, …) — there is **no mirror struct and no save/restore on
  switch**. `activateWorkbench(workbench)` just sets `this.workbench`, swaps the overlay
  child (`overlay.setChild(workbench.root)`), and re-selects the row. `activateOwner(owner)`
  resolves a person → their `Workbench`; `cycleWorkbench(±1)` (bound to `super-,` /
  `super-.`) steps the active workbench through `[user, …agents]` (the workbench-list
  order), wrapping. Detached workbenches stay alive, so a terminal's scrollback / open
  editors survive a switch. An agent's workbench opens terminal-only — `showSideDock` is
  false for agents, so Files/Source-Control isn't docked on open; the panel is still built
  (so `this.workbench.fileTree`/`gitPanel` stay valid and `file-tree:focus`/git commands
  can reveal it). The terminal auto-opens on creation (`openAgent` → `buildWorkbench(agent, cwd)`);
  `closeAgent` drops it from `workbenches` and disposes its editors / file tree /
  git panel / bottom-dock panels (no leak). **Done since:** per-workbench roots +
  pooled `GitRepo` (see *git worktree integration* below); session restore of agent
  workbenches (each serialized as a `WorkspaceState`, relaunched resumed — work-area
  file-tab layout still deferred).
- **`src/ui/AgentTerminal.ts`** *(the `claude-tui` kind)* — a `Terminal` subclass
  that spawns the agent CLI (`agent.command` config, default `['claude']`); the
  Claude integration lives in `src/agents/claude-tui/session.ts` (`ClaudeSession`,
  arg/`--settings` injection + the status/edited-files/rename watchers). Notable
  behaviour:
  - initial title = the agent's program basename until the CLI reports its own
    (OSC) title; `prompt` option appends a launch prompt to argv;
  - on process exit the widget is **not** torn down and the agent/workbench is **not**
    closed — it prints a "process exited" notice, flips to `exited`, and stays
    listed; the user restarts (`agent:restart`/`r`) or stops (`agent:stop`/`x`) it
    from the workbench list. Closing its tab (`tab:close`) never retires it — it just
    backgrounds it (a running agent keeps working); `agent:close`/`d d` retires it;
  - **live status** (`idle | working | waiting | exited`, via `status` /
    `onDidChangeStatus`): for a `claude` agent it injects a per-session
    `--settings` block whose **hooks** write a status word to a file the terminal
    watches with a `Gio.FileMonitor`. Reporter: `assets/hooks/agent-status.sh`.
    `UserPromptSubmit`/`PreToolUse`→working, `Notification`→waiting/idle,
    `Stop`/`SessionStart`→idle.
- **`src/agents/claude-sdk/` + `src/ui/AgentConversation.ts`** *(the `claude-sdk`
  kind)* — drives a persistent `claude -p` stream-json process and renders the
  turn natively. Full doc: **[agents/claude-sdk.md](agents/claude-sdk.md)**. Shape:
  - `transport.ts` (spawn + NDJSON line framing) → `SdkSession.ts` (turn queue,
    event→domain mapping, status/changedFiles/sessionId/cost, control protocol) →
    `AgentConversation.ts` (the native transcript host). `SdkSession` exposes the
    **same observable surface** `AgentTerminal` does, so the manager/sidebar/picker
    stay tool-agnostic.
  - **Built & verified live:** turn loop; thinking + token meter; tool rows with
    nerdfont icons (Bash highlighted + one-line crop); permission gating via the
    bundled stdio MCP `assets/mcp/quilxPermission.mjs` (`--permission-prompt-tool`,
    atomic file IPC) → native allow/deny card; **interrupt** (control_request, on
    `ctrl-c`); **subagents** (captured per-`Agent`-tool transcript, inline button +
    sticky panel + pushed `Adw.NavigationView` page, kept out of the main thread);
    **shell monitors** (sticky panel + inspect page + cancel via `stop_task`);
    **AskUserQuestion** as an `Adw.ViewSwitcher` card (j/k/h/l + notes; answered over
    the only working channel, the permission deny-message); **message queueing** while
    busy (right-aligned "Pending" bubble); unknown events surfaced as raw-JSON rows.
  - UI is split under `src/ui/conversation/`: `format.ts` (pure helpers, tested),
    `StickyListPanel.ts` (Tasks/Subagents/Monitors), `cards.ts` (permission),
    `QuestionCard.ts`, `SubagentView.ts`, `MonitorView.ts`.
  - **Deferred:** conversation resume + session serialize for sdk (`serialize()`
    returns null → not persisted across editor restart); token-level live streaming.
- **`src/AgentManager.ts` — `quilx.agents`** — the registry: `add`/`remove`/
  `getAgents` (launch order) + `onDidAddAgent`/`onDidRemoveAgent`.
  The agent list / sidebar is `WorkbenchList` (not a separate `AgentList`).
- **`src/ui/WorkbenchList.ts`** — the contents of the **WorkbenchSidebar** (the
  full-height column at the very left of the window, outside/left of the header
  bar; AppWindow wraps everything in a top-level horizontal `Gtk.Paned` —
  `sidebarSplit` — whose start child is the sidebar). Each entry is (will be)
  associated with a particular **workbench**: the first ("default",
  selected-by-default) row is the **user** (person glyph + name, as a pseudo-agent
  — `onActivateUser`), the rest are the running agents (status indicator + title +
  changed-files badge). **Never empty** (the user row is always present → no empty
  state); every row is one header-bar tall. Its top is an `Adw.HeaderBar` (themed
  to match the window header bar) whose only content is a flat **logo button**
  (a square placeholder glyph for now — will become the real logo — styled like the
  git branch button) that collapses the sidebar to icons-only / expands to
  icons+text — the width change is applied by the host via `onToggleCollapsed`
  (`sidebarSplit` position between `LAYOUT_SIDEBAR_COLLAPSED_WIDTH` and
  `LAYOUT_SIDEBAR_WIDTH`).
- **`src/ui/AgentPicker.ts`** — fuzzy quick-switcher over running agents, with a
  *Start agent: `<query>`* action that launches a new agent with the typed prompt.
- **`AppWindow`** — `openAgent(prompt?)` / `showAgent` (reattaches a persisted
  widget, gated on `getRoot()` so a desynced tab map can't strand or rip it),
  `agentChildren` (agent → center tab), `agent:new` / `agent:picker` commands,
  focus→`selectAgent`, and retiring an agent from the registry when its **exited**
  tab is closed.

## Feature: agent profiles & customization

Replace the single `agent.command` with **named profiles** (agent *types*), so the
user can keep several configured agents and pick one when starting.

### Config schema (`agent.*`)

```ts
interface AgentProfile {
  name: string;                 // display + list/picker label
  kind?: 'claude' | 'generic';  // drives status integration (default inferred from command[0])
  command: string[];            // argv; default ['claude']
  description?: string;
  cwd?: string;                 // default: session cwd (see worktrees)
  env?: Record<string, string>;
  // claude-kind extras, translated to flags / --settings:
  model?: string;               // --model
  allowedTools?: string[];      // --allowed-tools
  permissionMode?: string;      // --permission-mode
  appendSystemPrompt?: string;  // --append-system-prompt
  addDirs?: string[];           // --add-dir
}
agent.profiles: AgentProfile[]   // new
agent.default: string            // profile name to use when unspecified
agent.command: string[]          // kept as a back-compat shorthand → a synthetic default profile
```

`resolveAgentCommand()` grows into a profile resolver. `buildStatusIntegration`
stays, gated on `kind === 'claude'` (or `basename(command[0]) === 'claude'`).
A `buildClaudeArgs(profile)` turns the claude extras into flags, merged with the
status `--settings` (claude lets later `--settings`/flags compose).

### Other tools than claude

`AgentTerminal` already runs arbitrary argv. The only claude-specific piece is the
hook-based status. So:

- **Generic kind** → no status hooks; status is just `working` (alive) vs `exited`
  — or stays a single neutral state. (We *could* still infer "waiting for input"
  for some tools later via heuristics, but not in the MVP.)
- Keep status reporting behind an **adapter seam**: today one `ClaudeStatusAdapter`
  (hooks + file watch). A second adapter (e.g. a tool that emits OSC/title states,
  or writes its own status file) can be slotted in by `kind` without touching the
  UI, which only sees `status` / `onDidChangeStatus`.

### UI

- The **picker/starter** gains a profile step: either a two-stage pick (choose
  profile → type prompt) or a prefix in the existing entry (`@review fix the bug`).
  Simplest first: a `agent:new` variant per profile, plus the default on `space a`.
- Optionally a small **config editor** entry (there is already `ConfigEditor`) —
  profiles are just `config.json`, so this is free to start.

## Feature: management UX

Concrete, mostly small additions on top of what exists:

- **Lifecycle commands** (registered on `AppWindow`, bound centrally in
  `src/keymaps/default.ts`; the list dispatches the selected row's command):
  - `agent:stop` — terminate the process (SIGTERM the VTE child) but keep the
    widget listed (it flips to `exited`, restartable). The list's `x` key / row action.
  - Closing the agent's tab (`tab:close`) never retires the agent, whatever its state:
    the terminal-tab close is vetoed (the terminal stays in its workbench — a running
    agent keeps working in the background, a stopped one stays listed) and the view falls
    back to the user's workbench; re-select the agent to bring it back.
  - `agent:close` — close for good: terminate the child if it's still running, remove its
    workbench, and retire it from the list (`closeAgent`). The list's `d d` key; acts on the
    selected row, or the active/last-focused agent from the command palette.
  - `agent:restart` (list `r`) / `agent:resume` (`space a r`) — respawn an exited
    agent in place, resuming its conversation; reuse the row.
  - `agent:focus-next` / `agent:focus-prev` — navigation (`focusAdjacentAgent`).
- **Attention notifications** — *partly done*: `AppWindow.notifyAgentAttention`
  posts an in-app `quilx.notifications` toast (click → reveal) when an agent goes
  **waiting** (needs input) or **working→idle** (finished) while its tab isn't the
  active panel child. Still **todo**: an **attention badge/count** on the sidebar
  header (number of `waiting` agents) and desktop notifications when the window is
  unfocused (see *More ideas → OS notifications*).
- **List ergonomics** — *done*: vim bare-key bindings while the WorkbenchList is
  focused (`j`/`k` move, `x` stop, `r` restart, `R` rename, `b` branch, `d d`
  close, `o` open-changes), mirroring FileTree; hover action buttons on rows.
- **Rename** — *done*: `AgentTerminal.rename()` pins a display name over the CLI's
  reported title (`renamed` reports whether pinned); `agent:rename` prompts via the
  picker (the `R` key in the list).
- **Tab affordance** — *done*: the agent's tab title is prefixed with a status glyph
  (`agentTabTitle` in AppWindow), refreshed on status change; mirrors the sidebar
  indicator, sans colour.

## Feature: resume / persist conversations

Claude Code stores every session as a JSONL transcript at
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl` (the dir name is the cwd with
*every non-alphanumeric char* → `-`; see `agentSessions.ts:transcriptDir`). A
session is resumed with `claude --resume <id>` (or
`--continue` for the latest); `--fork-session` branches a copy instead of
appending. These compose with our `--settings` block, so status hooks keep working.

**Built (`src/agentSessions.ts`, `AgentTerminal`, `AppWindow`):**

- **Capture** — the hook reporter writes the live `session_id` (present in every
  hook payload) to `<statusFile>.session`; `AgentTerminal.sessionId` reads it.
- **Enumerate** — `listAgentSessions(cwd)` reads the transcript dir: filename → id,
  mtime → last activity, first `type:"user"` line → label. Newest first. Only the
  head of each transcript is read (cheap). All format-parsing is isolated here, as
  the JSONL format is Claude Code's internal one (subject to change).
- **Resume** — `AgentTerminal` takes a `resume: { sessionId? | continue?; fork? }`
  option → prepends `--resume <id>` / `--continue` (+ `--fork-session`) to the
  claude argv. Commands: `agent:resume` (`space a r`, resume the current *exited*
  agent in place), `agent:resume-conversation` (`space a R`, a picker of past
  sessions excluding any currently live — label + relative time),
  `agent:continue` (`space a c`, latest conversation in this folder), and
  `agent:branch` (`space a b` / list `b`, fork the current agent via
  `--fork-session`).
- **Persist across editor restarts** — `AgentTerminal.serialize()` now records
  `sessionId`; the (Session-management-owned) restore can relaunch a saved agent as
  `--resume <id>` to continue the conversation rather than start fresh. The
  `TabState` agent variant gained an optional `sessionId`.

**Open**: surface session branch/cost in the resume list; resume-with-prompt;
offer fork on resuming a *live* session; honor `cleanupPeriodDays` (transcripts are
pruned after ~30 days).

## Feature: reviewing an agent's work

Goal: let the user review **what one agent changed** — while it works (ongoing) or
after (past). The obstacle: a working tree shared by several agents (the main
folder, *or a worktree that hosts more than one agent* — see below) mixes
everyone's edits, so a plain `git diff` can't attribute a change to one agent.
Per-agent attribution is therefore the **primary** mechanism, needed even when
worktrees are in play. (Observed usage: parallel agents mostly edit **disjoint**
areas, so attribution-without-full-isolation is good enough for the common case.)

### Per-agent baselines (the attribution mechanism)

Capture each agent's "before" so its diff is well-defined:

- A `PreToolUse` hook on `Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit` copies the target
  file's *current* content into `<statusFile>.baseline/<encoded-path>` the **first**
  time this agent touches it — "the file as it was right before agent A started."
  Pairs with the existing `PostToolUse` → `.files` log (the touched set / "after").
- Agent A's change to a file = `diff(baseline, current)`. Tool-agnostic and under
  our control. (Claude keeps its own snapshots under `~/.claude/file-history/`, but
  it's internal/undocumented — at most a fallback for resumed sessions with no
  baseline.)
- Works in **any** tree, which is why it's primary: a worktree can hold several
  agents, so the worktree's own `git diff` ≠ a single agent's work.

### Review UI

- An **"Agent Changes" panel** — a `LocationList`-style list (like Diagnostics) of
  the agent's changed files with ± counts; selecting one opens its diff. The "✎ N"
  badge / `o` key graduates from "open the files" to "review the changes."
- A **diff view** per file (`baseline → current`): next/prev change, optionally
  per-hunk accept / revert.
- **Depends on the editor Diff renderer** (`code-editing/diff.md`, not built yet) —
  that's the rendering substrate. Sequence: diff display → agent review.

### Ongoing vs past

- **Ongoing**: a `Gio.FileMonitor` (reuse the `.files` watch) keeps the diff live as
  the agent edits.
- **Past**: baselines persist after the process exits (cleaned with `.files` /
  `.session` when the agent is retired), so a finished agent stays reviewable.
  Resumed sessions with no baseline fall back to claude's file-history or `git diff`.

### Parallel agents in one tree

- **Disjoint files** (the common case) → clean per-agent diffs, nothing more needed.
- **Overlap** (two live agents edit the same file): compare agents' `changedFiles`
  sets and **flag the overlap** in the agent list — attribution muddies and the
  agents can stomp each other. True isolation for that case = worktrees (below).

## Feature: git worktree integration

Goal: let agents run in **worktrees** (not only the main folder) so a group of
related agents shares an isolated branch, and "viewing an agent" re-roots the
editor to its worktree. **A worktree is its own axis, N:1 with agents — more than
one agent can run in the same worktree.** So a worktree gives *isolation between
worktrees*, while telling agents apart *within* a worktree still relies on the
per-agent baselines above.

**Decisions (2026-06-17):** full per-workbench root (not a scoped MVP view); the
**agent** creates worktrees (`git worktree add`), quilx only detects + re-roots —
no quilx-side `worktree add/remove`; association is **both** launch-time (pick an
existing worktree) and dynamic (the agent moves into one mid-session); dynamic
detection is **cooperative** (the agent announces via an MCP tool) with a hook
**validator** that warns if it changes worktree without announcing.

### Architecture (as built)

Root ownership lives on the **`Workbench`** (`cwd` + `git`), not the window. The
window chrome and pickers read the *active* workbench; an agent's workbench can
re-root independently. Pieces and how they connect:

- **Per-workbench root** — `Workbench.{cwd, git}`. `AppWindow.buildWorkbench(owner,
  cwd)` acquires a pooled `GitRepo` and roots `FileTree`/`GitPanel` at `cwd`. There
  is no `AppWindow.git`; every git/cwd call site reads `this.workbench.*`.
- **GitRepo pool** (`git.ts`) — `acquireGitRepo(cwd)` / `releaseGitRepo(repo)`,
  ref-counted and keyed by repo top-level. Several workbenches in one root (N agents
  : 1 worktree) share one polling `CliGitRepo`; a linked worktree keys separately,
  so it gets its own branch/status. The repo is disposed when the last holder
  releases.
- **Chrome follows the active workbench** — `activateWorkbench` → `rebindGitChrome()`
  re-points `GitBranchButton.setRepo`, `GithubService.rebind`, `GithubButtons.setRepo`
  and the upstream-behind watch at `this.workbench.{git, cwd}`.
- **Agent → editor bridge** (cooperative dynamic detection). Data flow for a worktree
  the agent creates mid-session:
  1. agent runs `git worktree add … && cd …`, then calls the **`set_worktree`** MCP
     tool (bundled stdio server `assets/mcp/quilxBridge.mjs`, wired via
     `--mcp-config` + pre-allowed in `--settings`, instructed by
     `--append-system-prompt`).
  2. the bridge writes the path to `$QUILX_STATUS_FILE.cwd` (atomic) — the same IPC
     channel as the status hooks.
  3. `ClaudeSession` watches `.cwd` → `host.onCwd` → `AgentTerminal.setEffectiveCwd`
     (recomputes `worktree`, fires `onDidChangeWorktree`).
  4. `AppWindow.reRootWorkbench` swaps the workbench's pooled git, re-roots
     `FileTree`/`GitPanel` in place (`setRoot`), re-points the gutters of editors
     owned by that workbench (`TextEditor.setGitRepo` → `GitGutter.setGit`, tracked
     via `editorOwners`), rebinds chrome if active, and refreshes the sidebar branch
     line (`WorkbenchList.refreshAgent`).
- **Validator** (safety net) — a `PostToolUse(Bash)` hook greps for `git worktree
  add <path>` and writes it to `$QUILX_STATUS_FILE.wtcreate`; if the agent settles
  to idle without a matching `set_worktree`, `AppWindow` warns once.
- **Sidebar branch line** — two-line agent rows (name / branch). The branch reads
  the workbench git's `getBranch()` and re-renders on its `onChange` (in-place
  checkouts); a worktree move re-points it via host-driven `refreshAgent` (avoids a
  read-before-swap race).
- **Launch-time** — `cli.listWorktrees()` + `WorktreePicker` / `agent:new-in-worktree`
  start an agent rooted in an existing worktree (`openAgent({cwd})`).
- **Resume** — restores a conversation's branch/worktree/cwd (`resumeOptions`).
  `AgentSession.cwd` is read from the transcript (Claude records its cwd per entry);
  `agent:picker` / `agent:resume-conversation` list sessions across every worktree
  (`agentSessionRoots()` → `listResumableSessions`) and resume in that cwd
  (`openAgent({cwd, resume})`) — both where `claude --resume` resolves the session
  *and* where the workbench roots. **Launch-time** worktrees restore directly (the
  transcript cwd *is* the worktree). **Dynamic** moves (the agent `cd`'d into a
  worktree mid-session via set_worktree; Claude's own cwd never changed, so the
  transcript still says the launch dir) are handled by a sidecar: on each announce
  `recordSessionWorktree` writes `effectiveCwd` next to the transcript
  (`<id>.quilx-worktree`); on resume we still spawn in the launch cwd (so `--resume`
  resolves) but inject a terse prompt telling the agent to **only** call
  `set_worktree(<W>)` and then stop — re-rooting the editor without kicking off work
  (Tier 1: cooperative, via the announce loop; no touching Claude's transcript
  storage).

Key files: `git.ts` (pool), `git/cli.ts` (`listWorktrees`), `Workbench.ts`,
`AppWindow.ts` (build/activate/re-root), `claudeAgent.ts` + `assets/mcp/quilxBridge.mjs`
+ `assets/hooks/agent-status.sh` (bridge/validator), `AgentTerminal.ts`,
`FileTree.ts`/`GitPanel.ts`/`GitGutter.ts` (`setRoot`/`setGit`), `WorkbenchList.ts`.

### Lifecycle (deferred)

Lifecycle is **per worktree, not per agent**: only when the **last** agent leaves a
worktree do we offer **keep / merge / discard** the branch — a worktree with
uncommitted/unmerged work is never removed implicitly. Deferred until after the
re-root foundation lands; co-design with per-agent review baselines (above) and
Session management (agent-workbench serialization already stores `cwd`).

## More ideas

Backlog beyond the three big features above, roughly in priority order. The first
group builds directly on the change-tracking / transcript plumbing that already
exists, so it's cheap and high-value; the rest are bigger or more speculative.

### Builds on what exists

- **Review an agent's diff** *(recommended next)* — promoted to its own design:
  see **Feature: reviewing an agent's work** above (per-agent baselines + an "Agent
  Changes" diff panel; the attribution mechanism that also works inside a shared
  worktree).
- **Live activity timeline** — a panel that tails the agent's transcript JSONL
  (already parsed by `agentSessions.ts` for resume) into a structured feed: tools
  used, files touched, assistant messages. A readable "what is it doing" view
  without watching the terminal scroll. Live via a `Gio.FileMonitor` on the
  transcript, isolated behind the same format-parsing seam as `agentSessions`.
- **OS notifications** — when an agent goes `waiting` / `working→idle` while the
  **window is unfocused**, fire a desktop `Gio.Notification` (today we only post
  in-app toasts via `notifyAgentAttention`). Gate on window focus; clicking the
  notification reveals the agent (same `reveal` callback).
- **Agent interrupt** — `agent:interrupt`: send ESC / `ctrl-c` to the child to stop
  the current action, a softer alternative to `agent:stop`. Trivial now that the
  modal terminal already sends ESC (`feedChild('\x1b')`); ctrl-c is `feedChild('\x03')`.
- **Jump to an agent's latest edit** — open the file the agent last touched **at the
  exact line** (not just the file). Needs the hook to record a position alongside the
  path in `<statusFile>.files` (e.g. the edit's first changed line), surfaced via the
  `o` action / a dedicated command.

### Bigger / speculative

- **Cost / context meter** — the claude `statusLine` JSON exposes `cost` and
  `context_window.used_percentage`; a second `--settings` `statusLine` hook could
  surface a per-agent cost/▮ context gauge in the row. (Deferred a couple of times;
  small and self-contained when picked up.)
- **Orchestration** — multiple agents on one task, or a "lead"/"review" agent
  watching another's diff. Speculative; out of scope until the basics are deep.

Done (moved out of ideas): **send-to-agent** (selection/file → current / picked /
new agent), **resume past conversations** (see the feature above), **file-change
awareness** (a `PostToolUse` Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit hook appends the
edited path to `<statusFile>.files`; `AgentTerminal.changedFiles` /
`onDidChangeFiles` watch it; the agent list shows a clickable "✎ N" badge whose
click — or the `o` key / `agent:open-changes` — opens the edited files, one
directly or several via a newest-first picker; each edit also triggers an immediate
`GitRepo.refresh()`), and **modal terminal input** (normal/insert via a focusable
container that steals focus from the Vte; see index.md).

## Shared concerns

- **Status is the spine.** Everything (dot, tab, notifications, badge) reads
  `AgentTerminal.status` / `onDidChangeStatus`; no parallel state.
- **Refresh** via the manager's events (`onDidAddAgent`/`onDidRemoveAgent`) + each
  agent's `onDidChangeStatus`; no manual cross-component pokes.
- **Feedback** through `quilx.notifications`, consistent with git ops.
- **Commands first, bindings central** (`src/keymaps/default.ts`), vim bare keys
  while the panel is focused — like FileTree.
- **Destructive ops** (kill, worktree discard) confirm first, never implicit.
- **Claude specifics stay isolated** behind the status adapter / arg builder, so
  the manager, list, and picker remain tool-agnostic.

## Phasing

- [x] **claude-sdk kind** — headless `claude -p` driven natively (transport +
      SdkSession + AgentConversation), shared `Agent` surface, kind registry
      (`configs.ts`, default `claude-tui`). Turn loop, permissions, interrupt,
      subagents, monitors, AskUserQuestion, queueing all built & verified live.
      Resume/serialize for sdk still deferred. See *agents/claude-sdk.md*.
- [ ] Profiles: `AgentProfile` config schema + resolver; back-compat with
      `agent.command`; `kind`-gated status integration
- [ ] Claude arg builder (model / tools / permission-mode / system-prompt) merged
      with the status `--settings`
- [ ] Picker/starter: choose a profile when launching
- [~] Attention notifications: in-app toasts on waiting / working→idle while the
      tab is inactive are done (`notifyAgentAttention`); header `waiting` badge and
      OS notifications while the window is unfocused are still todo
- [x] Lifecycle commands: kill / close / restart / focus-next/prev (+ bindings,
      per-row hover actions)
- [x] Status in the tab title; rename
- [x] File-change awareness (PostToolUse hook → `.files`; agent-list badge)
- [ ] Editor Diff renderer (`code-editing/diff.md`) — substrate for review (blocks below)
- [ ] Review work: per-agent baselines (PreToolUse snapshot → `.baseline/`); "Agent
      Changes" diff panel (baseline → current); live (FileMonitor) + post-exit
- [ ] Overlap warning when two live agents edit the same file (compare `changedFiles`)
- [x] **Git worktree integration** — per-workbench cwd+git, launch-time + dynamic
      (MCP bridge) worktrees, re-root, resume restore. See *Feature: git worktree
      integration → Architecture (as built)* above.
- [ ] **Worktree lifecycle** (deferred) — keep/merge/discard when last agent leaves;
      per-worktree vs per-agent (baseline) review granularity

## Open questions

- **Profile selection UX**: two-stage picker (profile → prompt) vs an `@profile`
  prefix in the prompt entry vs per-profile `agent:new:<name>` commands?
- **Generic-tool status**: leave non-claude agents at alive/exited, or attempt a
  generic "waiting for input" heuristic (PTY idle / prompt detection)?
- **Review granularity inside a shared worktree**: N agents per worktree means the
  worktree's `git diff` mixes them — is the default review view the *worktree* diff,
  the *per-agent* (baseline) diff, or both side by side? Baselines are the precise
  per-agent answer; the worktree diff is the "what's the net state" answer.
- **Baseline cost**: snapshot-on-first-edit (`PreToolUse` copy) is cheap per file
  but unbounded across a long session — cap by count/size, or rely on git for large
  files? And dedupe baselines when several agents share a worktree + file.
- **Kill semantics**: `agent:stop` SIGTERMs the VTE child directly — could add a
  `claude`-aware graceful shutdown. (Closing a *running* agent's tab does **not**
  kill it — it backgrounds the agent.)
